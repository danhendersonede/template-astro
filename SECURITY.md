## 🔒 Security for Your Project

This template includes security best practices for Astro projects. **Important**: You should customize this security policy for your specific project needs.

### 📝 For Template Users

**Before deploying your project:**

1. **Update this file** - Replace template-specific content with your project details
2. **Set up vulnerability reporting** - Add your contact method for security issues
3. **Review all security settings** - Ensure they match your project requirements

### 🚨 Template Vulnerabilities

If you find security issues in this template itself, please:

- Create an issue in the template repository
- For sensitive issues, contact the template maintainer privately

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

This template includes several security features and follows best practices:

### Built-in Security Features

- **TypeScript**: Type safety prevents many runtime errors
- **ESLint**: Catches potential security issues
- **Dependency scanning**: Regular updates and vulnerability checks
- **Environment variables**: Secure configuration management
- **Content Security Policy**: (Configure in production)

### Recommended Security Measures

When using this template:

1. **Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   # Never commit secrets to version control
   # Use .env files (already in .gitignore)
   API_KEY=your-secret-key
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   ```

2. **Dependencies**

   ```bash
   # Regularly audit dependencies
   npm audit
   npm audit fix

   # Keep dependencies updated
   npm update
   ```

3. **Content Security Policy**

   ```html
   <!-- Add to your <head> for production -->
   <meta
     http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
     content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
   />
   ```

4. **HTTPS**
   - Always use HTTPS in production
   - Update `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in `.env` to use `https://`

## 🔍 Security Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] All secrets moved to environment variables
- [ ] Dependencies audited and updated
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Content Security Policy configured
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] File uploads (if any) properly validated
- [ ] Database queries (if any) use parameterized statements

## 📋 Template Support

| Template Version | Status                |

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### Development vs Production

- **Development**: Some features prioritize developer experience
- **Production**: Additional security measures should be implemented

### Third-party Integrations

When adding integrations:

- Review permissions and access
- Use official packages when possible
- Keep integrations updated
- Remove unused integrations
